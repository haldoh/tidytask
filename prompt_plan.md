Below is a **multi-round breakdown** of how to implement the Personal Task Management App, followed by a **series of prompts** that you can feed into a code-generation LLM. Each prompt is carefully crafted to build on the previous steps, adopting best practices, strong testing, and incremental progress.

---

## **1. High-Level Blueprint**

1. **Set Up Project Foundations**  
   - Initialize the **Rails** backend project.  
   - Configure **RSpec** for testing.  
   - Add **basic gems/plugins** (e.g., Devise for auth, Sidekiq, etc.).  

2. **Implement Core Models & Migrations**  
   - **Task** model with minimal attributes (title, completed).  
   - **User** model (for authentication & ownership of tasks).  
   - Set up associations and validations.  
   - Write **model specs** (RSpec) for these core models.  

3. **Implement Basic Task CRUD & Testing**  
   - Create **TasksController** (or Tasks API endpoints).  
   - **CRUD actions** (index, create, show, update, delete).  
   - Write **request specs** to confirm CRUD is working.  

4. **Soft Delete Functionality**  
   - Introduce `deleted_at` column, update logic to filter tasks by default.  
   - Add **test coverage** for soft deletion, restoration, and permanent removal.  

5. **Recurring Tasks**  
   - Extend the **Task** model to handle `recurring` booleans and a `recurrence_pattern`.  
   - Write **service class** or **model-level methods** to generate next occurrences.  
   - Test each scenario with **model specs**.  

6. **Natural Language Parsing (NLP)**  
   - Integrate a lightweight NLP approach for string-based input.  
   - Add test coverage for various input examples.  
   - Expose an endpoint to handle the **“Create Task from text”** flow.  

7. **Notifications & Reminders**  
   - Integrate **Sidekiq** or a background job to schedule reminders.  
   - Configure **Push notifications** (FCM).  
   - Test that jobs queue properly, confirm push notifications with a test harness.  

8. **Frontend Integration**  
   - **React.js** for web + **React Native** for mobile.  
   - Basic authentication flow, hooking to the Rails backend.  
   - Basic UI for **task creation, listing, completion**.  
   - Write **end-to-end (E2E) tests** (e.g., Cypress for Web, or Detox for React Native).  

9. **Refinement & Optimization**  
   - Add final features (task filtering, advanced recurrence patterns).  
   - Polishing the UI/UX.  
   - Address **performance** concerns and **security** audits.  

10. **Deployment & Continuous Integration**  
    - Set up your CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).  
    - **Production deployment** (Heroku, AWS, etc.).  
    - Final round of **user acceptance testing**.

## **2. Break Into Iterative Chunks**

Here’s a more **granular** breakdown—each chunk focuses on a measurable, testable piece. After this, we’ll **break each chunk down further**:

1. **Chunk A:** Project Setup  
2. **Chunk B:** Basic Models & Migrations  
3. **Chunk C:** Task CRUD & Testing  
4. **Chunk D:** Soft Delete & Testing  
5. **Chunk E:** Recurring Tasks (Basic)  
6. **Chunk F:** NLP Parsing Service (Basic)  
7. **Chunk G:** Notifications & Background Jobs  
8. **Chunk H:** Integrate Web Frontend (React)  
9. **Chunk I:** Integrate Mobile Frontend (React Native)  
10. **Chunk J:** Final Integration, Polish, and Deployment  

---

## **3. Refine Each Chunk Into Small Steps**

Below is a set of steps you might take *within* each chunk to keep progress **incremental** and **test-driven**.

### **Chunk A: Project Setup**  
1. **Initialize Rails Project** (`rails new personal-task-manager -T --database=postgresql`)  
2. **Add RSpec & Devise Gems**  
3. **Configure RSpec** (basic `.rspec` & `spec_helper.rb`)  
4. **Run initial tests** (they should pass trivially, as no code is written yet).  

### **Chunk B: Basic Models & Migrations**  
1. **Generate User Model** (Devise or standard).  
2. **Generate Task Model** (only minimal fields: `title:string`, `completed:boolean`).  
3. **Add associations** (`User has_many :tasks`).  
4. **Write unit tests** for these models (validations, associations).  

### **Chunk C: Task CRUD & Testing**  
1. **Generate TasksController**.  
2. **Implement `index`** – test with RSpec request specs.  
3. **Implement `create`** – test creation scenarios (valid/invalid).  
4. **Implement `show`** – test retrieval.  
5. **Implement `update`** – test updates (valid/invalid).  
6. **Implement `delete`** – test deletion.  

### **Chunk D: Soft Delete & Testing**  
1. **Add `deleted_at:datetime`** to `tasks`.  
2. **Update model** to only fetch `where(deleted_at: nil)` by default.  
3. **Add scopes** (`default_scope`, or manual scopes like `.active`).  
4. **Write specs** to confirm tasks are hidden after soft delete, can be restored, etc.  

### **Chunk E: Recurring Tasks (Basic)**  
1. **Add `recurring:boolean` and `recurrence_pattern:string`** to `tasks`.  
2. **Add simple logic** (e.g., once a recurring task is completed, clone it with a new date?).  
3. **Test the logic** for generating the next occurrence.  
4. **Edge Cases** – no next occurrence if pattern is missing, etc.  

### **Chunk F: NLP Parsing Service (Basic)**  
1. **Create a service class** (`app/services/task_parser.rb`).  
2. **Parse strings** like “Pay rent on the 1st of every month.”  
3. **Extract** title, due date, recurrence, priority, etc.  
4. **Test** the parser with multiple input cases.  

### **Chunk G: Notifications & Background Jobs**  
1. **Add Sidekiq** to Gemfile, set up a Redis instance for local dev.  
2. **Create a job** that checks tasks nearing due_date and sends notifications.  
3. **Integrate FCM** (store FCM tokens for users).  
4. **Write tests** verifying the job is enqueued, sends push notifications.  

### **Chunk H: Integrate Web Frontend (React)**  
1. **Bootstrapped React App** (Create React App or Vite).  
2. **Setup Redux** (or another state manager).  
3. **Implement** login flow with your Rails sessions/Devise.  
4. **Implement** tasks listing + creation UI.  
5. **Basic E2E Tests** (Cypress or React Testing Library).  

### **Chunk I: Integrate Mobile Frontend (React Native)**  
1. **Initialize React Native** project.  
2. **Configure** API client + authentication.  
3. **Implement** minimal screens for listing tasks, adding tasks.  
4. **Handle** push notifications in mobile (FCM).  
5. **Add** manual testing on an emulator or real device.  

### **Chunk J: Final Integration, Polish, & Deployment**  
1. **Tidy up** UI, handle edge cases.  
2. **Add** final touches to NLP, recurring tasks (like “every 3rd Wednesday”).  
3. **Set up** CI/CD pipeline.  
4. **Deploy** to production environment.  
5. **Final** round of testing and user acceptance.

## **4. Iterative Prompts for a Code-Generation LLM**

Each prompt below is wrapped in ```````text``````` code fences. You would feed them *in sequence* to a code-generation LLM (like ChatGPT or another code-focused model), ensuring each prompt builds directly on the code produced in the previous steps.

> **Important:**  
> 1. The **LLM** should generate tests (RSpec specs, for example) **before** writing the implementation.  
> 2. Then you run those tests (they fail).  
> 3. The LLM writes the **minimum** code needed to pass the tests.  
> 4. This cycle ensures **test-driven development** (TDD).  
> 5. Each prompt references the code structure **from the previous prompt** to avoid orphaned or duplicative code.  

---

### **Prompt A: Project Setup**

```````text
You are helping me build a Ruby on Rails application called "personal-task-manager". 
Please do the following, step by step:

1. Initialize a new Rails project without default tests, using PostgreSQL:
   - rails new personal-task-manager -T --database=postgresql

2. Add and configure RSpec for testing:
   - Include 'rspec-rails' in the Gemfile.
   - Run bundle install.
   - Install RSpec via rails generate rspec:install.
   - Show the resulting Gemfile and the .rspec file.

3. Integrate Devise (though we won't fully configure it yet):
   - Include 'devise' in the Gemfile.
   - Show the updated Gemfile after adding Devise.
   - rails generate devise:install

4. Ensure everything is committed to version control.

Provide the new Gemfile, .rspec, and any relevant initial setup files, 
along with any instructions you’d like to highlight for me to keep 
the project structure clean. 
```````


### **Prompt B: Basic Models & Migrations**

```````text
Continuing from the previous codebase, create the initial User and Task models with basic fields:

1. Generate the User model using Devise. For now, let’s keep it minimal (email, password).
2. Generate the Task model with:
   - title:string (not null)
   - completed:boolean (default: false)
   - user:references (to associate the task with a user)
3. Write RSpec model tests to ensure:
   - A Task is invalid without a title
   - A Task defaults to completed=false
   - A Task belongs to a User
   - A User can have many tasks
4. Provide the migration files and the model code, then provide the RSpec files. 
   Make sure the tests fail initially if the code is incomplete.
```````


### **Prompt C: Task CRUD & Testing**

```````text
We have our models. Next, build out the tasks API with a TasksController (or resource) using TDD:

1. Write an RSpec request spec for:
   - GET /tasks (should return tasks for the current user)
   - POST /tasks (creates a new task)
   - GET /tasks/:id (shows a single task)
   - PUT/PATCH /tasks/:id (updates task attributes)
   - DELETE /tasks/:id (soft-delete, but we’ll handle soft-delete later, 
     for now just remove from DB)
2. Initially, write the request specs so that they fail (controller not implemented yet).
3. Implement just enough code in the TasksController to make the specs pass.
4. Show the updated routes, the TasksController, and the passing request specs.
```````


### **Prompt D: Soft Delete & Testing**

```````text
Now, let's add soft delete functionality:

1. Add 'deleted_at:datetime' to the Task model (rails g migration AddDeletedAtToTasks deleted_at:datetime).
2. Update the Task model to ignore records where deleted_at is not nil.
3. Modify the DELETE /tasks/:id action to set deleted_at instead of actually deleting the record.
4. Update the request specs to test that the task is not truly removed from the database, 
   but is no longer visible in the index and show endpoints.
5. Provide the updated migration, the Task model changes, the updated controller code, 
   and the updated passing specs.
```````


### **Prompt E: Recurring Tasks (Basic)**

```````text
Continuing from the existing codebase, let's handle simple recurring tasks:

1. Add two columns to the Task model:
   - recurring:boolean (default: false)
   - recurrence_pattern:string (nullable)
2. Write RSpec model tests that validate:
   - If recurring is true, recurrence_pattern must be present.
   - A method #generate_next_occurrence(date) returns a new Task instance 
     with the next date derived from recurrence_pattern (very basic for now).
3. Implement the logic in the Task model or a service class to:
   - Parse a simple "daily" or "weekly" pattern from recurrence_pattern.
   - Return a new Task with the next due date set to today + 1 day or 1 week.
4. Show the updated model, any new service class, and passing tests.
```````


### **Prompt F: NLP Parsing Service (Basic)**

```````text
Let’s introduce a basic NLP parser for task creation:

1. Create a service object `app/services/task_parser.rb` that accepts a plain text string (e.g. “Pay rent every month on the 1st”).
2. It should attempt to parse:
   - Title
   - Due date
   - Priority (default: Low if not found)
   - Recurrence pattern (optional)
3. Write RSpec tests that feed various strings into the parser and expect correct extraction. 
4. Make sure the parser is modular so we can improve it later. 
5. Update the TasksController create endpoint to optionally use this parser 
   if a request param like `text_input` is provided. 
6. Show the updated parser code, tests, and controller changes.
```````


### **Prompt G: Notifications & Background Jobs**

```````text
Now, let’s set up a background job system for task reminders:

1. Add and configure Sidekiq in the Gemfile, plus the necessary config for Redis.
2. Create a job (e.g., `ReminderJob`) that will:
   - Query tasks whose due_date is near, 
   - Send push notifications to the user (we'll store FCM tokens on the user record).
3. Write RSpec tests for the job:
   - Ensure it enqueues properly,
   - Mocks sending notifications,
   - Verifies correct tasks are selected.
4. Show me the updated Gemfile, any initializer changes, the job code, 
   and the RSpec job tests.
```````


### **Prompt H: Integrate Web Frontend (React)**

```````text
Now we’ll introduce a React front-end. We'll keep it minimal at first:

1. Initialize a React app (using Create React App or Vite).
2. Show the package.json with dependencies (axios for HTTP requests, perhaps Redux).
3. Set up a simple login flow that calls our Rails Devise endpoints (email + password).
4. Implement a TasksList component that:
   - Fetches tasks from the Rails backend,
   - Displays them,
   - Has a form to create new tasks (using either normal fields or text_input for NLP).
5. Add an integration test with React Testing Library that checks:
   - The tasks are rendered when the API returns them,
   - Creating a task calls the Rails API,
   - The new task appears in the list.
6. Show me the relevant React code, test code, and any instructions for building/running.
```````


### **Prompt I: Integrate Mobile Frontend (React Native)**

```````text
We will now create a minimal React Native app:

1. Initialize a React Native project (Expo or bare RN).
2. Configure the same authentication approach (OAuth or Devise tokens).
3. Implement a simple TaskList screen:
   - Fetch tasks from the API,
   - Create tasks from a form or a single text input field,
   - Mark tasks complete (PATCH request).
4. Add instructions or placeholders for push notification integration (FCM).
5. Provide a minimal Jest test that ensures the components render and 
   the API is called on mount.
6. Show me the relevant code for the React Native app, plus any test code or instructions.
```````


### **Prompt J: Final Integration, Polish, & Deployment**

```````text
Finally, let’s tie up everything, polish the app, and prepare for deployment:

1. Review each part of the system (Rails, React, React Native) for any TODOs.
2. Enhance the NLP parser to handle more patterns (e.g., “every 3rd Wednesday”).
3. Add final UI refinements (loading states, error messages).
4. Configure a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) with:
   - Automatic test runs on push,
   - Lint checks for Rails and JavaScript code.
5. Provide a sample Heroku or AWS setup guide or config 
   (Procfile, environment variables, etc.).
6. Summarize the entire code structure, providing a final 
   “installation and run” doc for me to easily launch everything.

## **Summary & Key Points**
- We’ve outlined **three levels** of planning:
  1. **High-Level Blueprint** (the entire scope).  
  2. **Iterative Chunks** (major phases of functionality).  
  3. **Detailed Steps** within each chunk (small TDD-friendly increments).  

- **Each prompt** references the previous code state, ensuring **no orphaned code**.  
- The approach is **test-driven**: you write specs *before* implementing features.  
- By the final prompt, you’ll have an end-to-end system (Rails backend, React web app, React Native mobile app, plus continuous deployment).

This structure should provide a **clean, iterative roadmap** that’s safe to implement with **strong testing** at every stage, preventing “big jumps” in complexity. Happy building!
